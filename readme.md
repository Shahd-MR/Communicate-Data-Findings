# Blue Bike System Data
## by Shahd Alruwaili


## Dataset

Blue Bike is a puplic service provided in Boston state, where poeple rent bikes for a single trip, or buy a monthly/annualy subscribtion, with more than 300 stations across Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Everett, and Somerville. This dataset contains records of Blue Bike trips from January to May of the year 2019.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that user type and day of week had an interesting relationship. Subscribers took more bike trips on workdays, while customers took more trips on weekends. The reason might be that subscribers use the bluebikes as a transportation option to go to their workplace.

Another surprising relationship I foun was between the user type and the average trip duration. Customers take much longer trips than subsicribers. Perhaps this is also due to the expectation that subscribers use the bikes only to get to work, and their workplace is not very far. Customers on the other hand, might use the bikes to do some excersie or to take tour around the city.

Subscribers and customers both prefer the warm months for taking bike trips, and the average duration of trips is slightly longer when the weather is warm for both of the user types. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I started by showing the distribution of bike trips over the months and over the weekdays using a bar plot. Then I showed the total number of subscribers versus customers. After that I focused on showing the bike riding patterns for subscribers and non-subscribers in terms of average duration, day of week, and month. I changed the sizes of the figures to be more readable. I also added figure titles and axes labels.
